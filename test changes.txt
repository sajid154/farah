these are test changes to show how to commit changes.
 ok?

step- 1 : git add .
2. git gui
3. git commit
 (sometimes it asks for username and email to set globally for next time)

type your email address there in git bash window 

now git gui commit will work

now git push

all set

now, all your code changes will be pushed in this way.

now make a new sample file and commit the changes
